Question 1: Unspecified Words

Problem Statement: There are N words in a dictionary such that each word is of fixed length M and consists only of lowercase English letters, that is (‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’, ………’z’).

A query word is denoted by Q.  The length of a query word is M. These words contain lowercase English letters but at some places instead of a letter between ‘a’, ‘b’……’z’ there is ‘?’. Refer to the Sample Input section to understand this case.

A match count of Q, denoted by match_count(Q), is the count of words that are in the dictionary and contain the same English letters(excluding a letter that can be in the position of ‘?’) in the same position as the letters are there in the query word  Q. In other words, a word in the dictionary can contain any letters at the position of ‘?’ but the remaining alphabets must match with the query word.

You are given a query word Q and you have required top compute match_count.

Input format:

The first line contains two space-separated integers N and M denoting the number of words in the dictionary and length of each word respectively
The next N lines contain one word each from the dictionary.
The next line contains an integer Q  denoting the number of query words for which you have to compute match_count,
The next Q lines contain one query word each.
Output format: For each query word print  match_count  for a specific word in a new line.

Constraints:

1<=N<=5 x 104
1<=M<=7
1<=q<=105
